## How to store on Filecoin

Because Filecoin is a decentralized storage marketplace, storage clients (our term for anyone who wants to store data on the Filecoin network) propose storage deals with storage miners that they feel can meet their storage needs. Once a storage client has proposed a deal, the miner can choose to accept or reject that deal. The client then sends over the data, and the storage deal officially begins!

In order to run the remainder of these commands, make sure you have a Filecoin node installed and running. See [Getting Started](Getting-Started) for more information.

## Test Filecoin with sample data

You can use your own data to test Filecoin. We recommend using small test files while you're still getting used to the different commands.

We put together a folder of [sample data](https://github.com/filecoin-project/sample-data) (images, GIFs, and text files) that you can get started with. Download this data, unzip it, and save it wherever you like. In the examples below, we will assume that you have saved the repo to your Desktop (`~/Desktop`).

## Import data

Before storing data on the Filecoin network, you'll first need to import the data into your local Filecoin node:

```sh
# Start by creating a simple .txt file
echo "Hi my name is $USER"> hello.txt

# Import the created file into go-filecoin.
# RETURN VAL: Content ID (CID) of this file.
# You'll need this CID for future commands to
# view, store, or retrieve this data.
export CID=`go-filecoin client import ./hello.txt`

# View the imported file
# RETURN VAL: "Hi my name is user1"
go-filecoin client cat $CID
```

You can also import and view files from your computer:

```sh
# Import an image from the sample data. Returns
# its CID which you'll need for the next step.
export CID=`go-filecoin client import ~/Desktop/sample-data-master/camel.jpg`

# View imported image
go-filecoin client cat $CID > image.jpg && open image.jpg
```

## Propose a storage deal

Once the data is imported, you can look through available _ask orders_ from miners. For now,  you'll manually choose one of them and propose a storage deal.

<!--# Check size of the imported file (in bytes)
go-filecoin client cat <CID> | wc -c
-->

To see all available asks, run this command:
```sh
go-filecoin client list-asks --enc=json | jq
```

You should see a list of asks, nicely formatted as JSON objects:

```json
{
  "Miner": "fcqxvnl37zdv8clc26j6r43zn8md7tc2mrfx77vru",
  "Price": "2.5",
  "Expiry": 588,
  "ID": 0,
  "Error": null
}
```

The price is in FIL per byte per blocktime (~30s), and the expiry is the blockchain height at which the ask expires. Choose an ask from that list. For now, the biggest difference between miners will be price. In the future, miners may have other characteristics.

Now, let's propose a storage deal. You'll need to include these 4 parameters:
* `<miner>` address of the miner from `list-asks`
* `<data>` CID of the imported data that you want to store
* `<ask>` ID of the ask, also from `list-asks` (usually 0)
* `<duration>` how long you want to store (in # of ~30sec blocktimes). For example, storing for 1 day (2 blocks/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day) = 2880 blocks.

```sh
go-filecoin client propose-storage-deal <miner> <data> <ask> <duration>
```

If the deal is proposed correctly, it will automatically be accepted and return `Status: accepted`. Currently, a deal will fail if the required capacity exceeds what that miner has available. A deal will also fail if your account's wallet FIL balance is insufficient to cover the asking cost over the proposed data size and duration.

## Send data and pay miner

As part of negotiating the deal, your `propose-storage-deal` command will automatically move the funds necessary to cover the cost of the deal into a payment channel with the storage miner.  This payment channel will periodically release payments to the storage miner across the lifetime of the deal.

Data is automatically transferred to a staging area via the underlying [bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/bitswap) mechanism (implementation from IPFS) of Filecoin. Miners will now be required to store your files on their machines and begin the sealing/proving process. Under the hood, filecoin miners automatically fire off a sealing process at some configured interval (default 120 seconds) to take all data in the miner's staging area and seal it into the miner's pledged storage sectors.  Your deal status will move to "staged" at this point.  After sealing is complete and the miner posts its commitment to the chain your deal status will move to "posted".

Check your deal state with:

```sh
go-filecoin client query-storage-deal <dealID>
```

## Retrieve your data

After the deal status becomes "posted, you will have successfully stored your data!

Before data can be retrieved from a sealed sector, the sector must be unsealed. At present, the sealing and unsealing processed are artificially fast so it will take around 5-10 minutes for you to retrieve a piece of data after you request it. Note that when Filecoin is working "for real," this number may be much longer.

```sh
# Retrieve your data, using the address of the
# miner you made a deal with and the <CID> of the data.
go-filecoin retrieval-client retrieve-piece <minerAddress> <CID> # can take a minute
```
